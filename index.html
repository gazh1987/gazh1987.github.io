					<p>	Welcome to my portfolio website. My name is Gary Healy. I am currently in my fourth and final year at Dublin Institute of Technology, 
						studying a BSc (Hons) in Computer Science. I am specializing in Applied Intelligence, Geographical 
						Information Systems and Rich Web Applications. I am also currently working on my fourth year project,
						"Rendezvous Friend Finder", which is a mobile Geographical Information System for Android. The app
						allows friends to track each others GPS coordinates and uses a compass an a map to aid navigation.</p>

						Games Development and Web Development. Outside of computing, I am intersted in 
						music, art and film.
