					<hr>
						<p> In second year at Dublin Institute of Technology I became interested in 2D games development. I created three games using
						the Processing Integrated Development Environment. The processing language builds on the Java language, but uses a simplified 
						syntax and graphics programming model. To play some of these games, please click the images below. This will navigate 
						you to <strong>www.OpenProcessing.org</strong> where the games are hosted. For best performance, I recommend that you play the games using the
						<strong>Mozilla Firefox </strong> web browser. You can also fork these repositories from my GitHub page. 
						You can find a link to my GitHub page in the header of this page to the left of the link to YouTube.</p>

				<article id = "ai">
					<hr>
					<p> This year at Dublin Institute of Technology I finally have the opportunity to study Artificial Intelligence which is something 
						that has interested me for some time now. In second year I created a Chat Bot in C# called DANI, which is short for Dynamic Artificial 
						Non-Intelligence. The user can communicate with DANI by typing on the command line. DANI uses collections to remember words and to
						build a vocabulary. The user can also make DANI learn things by typing "Learn" followed by what the user wants DANI to learn. Example: typing
						"Learn Michael Schumacher is a Formula One driver" makes Dani store the string "Michael Schumacher is a Formula One driver". The next time
						Michal Schumacher or Formula one is referenced in a sentance, DANI is able to output this information on screen. I have included a youtube video
						of an interaction with DANI below and you can also fork this project from GitHub by clicking the GitHub image link in the header next to the YouTube
						link.
